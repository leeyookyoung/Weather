## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->
This is an app for the [Android Dev Challenge for Week 4 - Weather](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/03/android-dev-challenge-4.html)
Actually I almost gave up because I knew that there was no submission of Android Dev Challenge but there wasn't.
When I got the last submission, left due was only two days.
But I'd changed my mind to challenge it, and I thought that even though I can't have done it, just try to do my best.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
I referenced [Korea's weather forecast system](https://www.weather.go.kr/w/index.do)
and I downloaded App's weather icons on the [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/categories/weather)
and I got a lot to learn from documentations of [animation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/animation) and [graphics](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/graphics)
